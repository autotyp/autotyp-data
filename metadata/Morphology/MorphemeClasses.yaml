  MorphemeType:
    description: >-
      Morpheme type (formative etc.) associated with this class of morphemes (missing values
      indicates no type restriction)
    kind: manual data entry
    data: value-list
    values: 
      "formative": >-
        Marker of a category that cannot occur as an independent part of speech unit in
        the syntax, but instead grammatically requires some host.
      "PoSWd": >-
        A syntactic unit that has its own part of speech (PoS) category. Depending on the
        diversity of grammatical words (g-word) in a language (see “word_type” database),
        this may or may not coincide with the g-word defined as ‘terminal node’. If
        g-word domains differ, “PoSWd” as used here refers to the one domain that has
        a PoS label attached to it. What counts is the syntactic behavior, e.g. if an
        element behaves like a verb but is defective morphologically, it still has the
        PoS label ‘verb’ (see for example Quileute negation ‘é’, which behaves like a verb
        syntactically even thought its inflectional paradigm is defective).
      "any": >-
        A unit that can be used both as a formative or as PoSWd, e.g. SEA versatile
        verbs/coverbs
      "SemiWd": >-
        DO NOT USE ANYMORE! Semiwords have some but not all the syntactic properties of
        ordinary SynWds. Typical examples of semiwords are incorpated nouns and verbs,
        as well as seperated preverbs and other particles that belong to a verbal lexeme.
        SemiWds belong to the same grammatical word as their host, and together with their
        host, they constitute an X-zero category in phrase-structure. But they retain some
        syntactic properties such as valence or PoS.
      "unknown": >-
        type is unknown at this time
      "Restricted Formative": >-
        DO NOT USE ANYMORE! Marker of an inflectional category that cannot occur as an
        independent part of speech unit in the syntax, but instead attaches to one and
        only specific stem or phrasal host category (e.g. only to noun stems)
      "Semi-restricted Formative": >-
        DO NOT USE ANYMORE! Marker of an inflectional category that cannot occur as an
        independent part of speech unit in the syntax, but instead attaches to a number of
        specific stem ot phrasal host categories (e.g. only to noun and verb stems).
      "Unrestricted Formative": >-
        DO NOT USE ANYMORE! Marker of an inflectional category that cannot occur
        as an independent part of speech unit in the syntax, but instead attaches
        indiscriminately to a any non-stem host available (words or phrases). Unrestricted
        formatives are traditionally called “particles” or “clitics”, but these terms
        are also used in other senses. Unrestricted formatives differ from PoSWds in that
        they attach to some host and cannot appear on their own, or establish their own
        independent part of speech element in the syntax.
      "Restricted derivative": >-
        DO NOT USE ANYMORE! Marker of an derivational category that cannot occur as an
        independent part of speech unit in the syntax, but instead attaches to one and
        only specific host category (e.g. only to noun stems)
      "stem": >-
        A morphological constituent that obligatorily combines with formatives (possibly
        zero) and derivatives and determines the part of speech of this combination (e.g.
        a noun stem that combines with case formatives to produce nouns). A stem differs
        from a PosWd in that a stem determines the PoS of the word to which it belongs,
        but it does not constitute a PoS on its own. ‘Stem” means entire stems, if only
        parts are refered to, use MphmType ID 13 ‘Stem Part’
      "stem part": >-
        An element of a stem (as defined under ID 12) that is not delimited by general
        extramorphological (prosodic, syntactic) principles. Typical example: the
        constituents of bipartite stems
      "root": >-
        An element of a stem that behaves differently from a stem. Only use when there is
        a difference in the language. Most languages do not differentiate stem and root
      "none": >-
        DO NOT USE ANYMORE! CODE AS n/aThere is no overt manifestation of the exemplar for
        which the record is made

  MorphemeHostRestriction:
    description: >-
      Host restrictions for this class of morphemes
    kind: manual data entry
    data: value-list
    values: 
      "restricted": >-
        Is restricted to a specific type of host. When descriptions are silent about
        the range of hosts that a marker can combine with, but analyze the marker as an
        “affix”, we assume it is restricted.
      "semi-restricted": >-
        Can occur with some, but not all host elements (so, NOT a ‘phrasal affix’, but
        rather simply a ‘particle’-like formative that has some degree of selectional
        restrictions). Allows at least two distinct hosts (in terms of their parts of
        speech categories)
      "unrestricted": >-
        occurs with anything (e.g. Turkish mi)
      "unknown": >-
        degree of restriction unknown at this time
      "Part circum/simulfix": >-
        even more restricted than restricted; used with simulfixation & circumfixation
      "restricted: Head": >-
        <don’t use this!> VERY RESTRICTED something like affix only to a head element (in
        a narrowed sense of RestrID 1)
      "restricted: Phrase": >-
        <don’t use this!> can occur with whatever POS element of that phrase it is
        adjacent to like Manange NP enclitics--they lean on whatever is last in the NP;
        used to deal with ‘phrasal affix’-like phenomena
