      Survey exemplar of grammatical marker (Tense, Case, Negation,

    kind: manual data entry
    data: value-list
    values: 
      "Case": >-
        The inflectional case marker selected for comparison in a user-defined survey.
        Selection procedure: If any of these markers differs from other in their
        morphological behavior, it refers to grammatical (core) case; if any core case
        marker differs from others, it refers to accusative, ergative or agentive case.
      "Negation": >-
        The form of standard clausal negation selected for comparison in a user-defined
        survey. Selection procedure: If there are several negation markers, pick the
        one on the left: - declarative indicative > other illocutionary roles and moods
        - Tense exemplar > other TAM values, i.e. past > perfective > realis > others -
        clausal scope > constituent scope - verbal predicate > other predicate - finite >
        nonfinite
      "Tense": >-
        The inflectional tense, aspect, mood, status, etc. marker selected for comparison
        in a user-defined survey. Selection procedure: If any of these markers differ
        from others in their morphological behavior, it refers to tense; if any tense
        marking differs from other tense markers, it refers to the tense used for basic,
        aspectually unmarked past time reference, i.e. to the form that serves as a simple
        response to ‘what happened’.
      "Noun Plural": >-
        The form of standard clausal negation selected for comparison in a user-defined
        survey. Selection procedure: If there are several negation markers, pick the
        one on the left: - declarative indicative > other illocutionary roles and moods

      Morpheme type (as defined in Bickel & Nichols 2007 (in Language typology
      and syntactic description, ed. T. Shopen, Cambridge: Cambridge
      University Press)
    kind: manual data entry
    data: value-list
    values: 
      "formative": >-
        Marker of a category that cannot occur as an independent part of speech unit in
        the syntax, but instead grammatically requires some host.
      "PoSWd": >-
        A syntactic unit that has its own part of speech (PoS) category. Depending on the
        diversity of grammatical words (g-word) in a language (see “word_type” database),
        this may or may not coincide with the g-word defined as ‘terminal node’. If g-
        word domains differ, “PoSWd” as used here refers to the one domain that has
        a PoS label attached to it. What counts is the syntactic behavior, e.g. if an
        element behaves like a verb but is defective morphologically, it still has the
        PoS label ‘verb’ (see for example Quileute negation ‘é’, which behaves like a verb
        syntactically even thought its inflectional paradigm is defective).
      "any": >-
        A unit that can be used both as a formative or as PoSWd, e.g. SEA versatile verbs/
        coverbs
      "SemiWd": >-
        DO NOT USE ANYMORE! Semiwords have some but not all the syntactic properties of
        ordinary SynWds. Typical examples of semiwords are incorpated nouns and verbs,
        as well as seperated preverbs and other particles that belong to a verbal lexeme.
        SemiWds belong to the same grammatical word as their host, and together with their
        host, they constitute an X-zero category in phrase-structure. But they retain some
        syntactic properties such as valence or PoS.
      "unknown": >-
        type is unknown at this time
      "Restricted Formative": >-
        DO NOT USE ANYMORE! Marker of an inflectional category that cannot occur as an
        independent part of speech unit in the syntax, but instead attaches to one and
        only specific stem or phrasal host category (e.g. only to noun stems)
      "Semi-restricted Formative": >-
        DO NOT USE ANYMORE! Marker of an inflectional category that cannot occur as an
        independent part of speech unit in the syntax, but instead attaches to a number of
        specific stem ot phrasal host categories (e.g. only to noun and verb stems).
      "Unrestricted Formative": >-
        DO NOT USE ANYMORE! Marker of an inflectional category that cannot occur
        as an independent part of speech unit in the syntax, but instead attaches
        indiscriminately to a any non-stem host available (words or phrases). Unrestricted
        formatives are traditionally called “particles” or “clitics”, but these terms
        are also used in other senses. Unrestricted formatives differ from PoSWds in that
        they attach to some host and cannot appear on their own, or establish their own
        independent part of speech element in the syntax.
      "Restricted derivative": >-
        DO NOT USE ANYMORE! Marker of an derivational category that cannot occur as an
        independent part of speech unit in the syntax, but instead attaches to one and
        only specific host category (e.g. only to noun stems)
      "stem": >-
        A morphological constituent that obligatorily combines with formatives (possibly
        zero) and derivatives and determines the part of speech of this combination (e.g.
        a noun stem that combines with case formatives to produce nouns). A stem differs
        from a PosWd in that a stem determines the PoS of the word to which it belongs,
        but it does not constitute a PoS on its own. ‘Stem” means entire stems, if only
        parts are refered to, use MphmType ID 13 ‘Stem Part’
      "stem part": >-
        An element of a stem (as defined under ID 12) that is not delimited by general
        extramorphological (prosodic, syntactic) principles. Typical example: the
        constituents of bipartite stems
      "root": >-
        An element of a stem that behaves differently from a stem. Only use when there is
        a difference in the language. Most languages do not differentiate stem and root
      "none": >-
        DO NOT USE ANYMORE! CODE AS n/aThere is no overt manifestation of the exemplar for
        which the record is made

    kind: manual data entry
    data: value-list
    values: 
      "restricted": >-
        Is restricted to a specific type of host. When descriptions are silent about
        the range of hosts that a marker can combine with, but analyze the marker as an
        “affix”, we assume it is restricted.
      "semi-restricted": >-
        Can occur with some, but not all host elements (so, NOT a ‘phrasal affix’, but
        rather simply a ‘particle’-like formative that has some degree of selectional
        restrictions). Allows at least two distinct hosts (in terms of their parts of
        speech categories)
      "unrestricted": >-
        occurs with anything (e.g. Turkish mi)
      "unknown": >-
        degree of restriction unknown at this time
      "Part circum/simulfix": >-
        even more restricted than restricted; used with simulfixation & circumfixation
      "restricted: Head": >-
        <don’t use this!> VERY RESTRICTED something like affix only to a head element (in
        a narrowed sense of RestrID 1)
      "restricted: Phrase": >-
        <don’t use this!> can occur with whatever POS element of that phrase it is
        adjacent to like Manange NP enclitics--they lean on whatever is last in the NP;
        used to deal with ‘phrasal affix’-like phenomena

  MarkerFusion:
    description: >-
      Phonological fusion of grammatical marker, as defined in Bickel &
      Nichols 2007 (in Language typology and syntactic description,
      ed. T. Shopen, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press)
    kind: manual data entry
    data: value-list
    values: 
      "isolating": >-
        The formative is a free phonological word. If it is, it is likely to be written
        as a separate word, though this is not always true: non-isolating formatives like
        clitics are often written as separate words, and isolating formatives are written
        with hyphens or clitic boundary markers. Therefore you will need to look at
        prosodic factors such as word stress.
      "concatenative": >-
        The formative is a clitic or segmentable affix. Word-level phonological processes
        (such as vowel harmony), word-internal kinds of sandhi, prosodic phenomena (such
        as word stress) or general inability to stand alone, identify a formative as
        concatenative (rather than an independent word). Unless there is evidence to the
        contrary, zeroes are coded as concatenative.
      "Nonconcatenative": >-
        No longer used. Instead, use the more specific type of nonconcatenative marking
        (Fusion ID #s 5ff). See log #40
      "unknown": >-
        Unknown
      "isolating_or_concatenative": >-
        Isolating as regards stress, concatenative as regards segmental rules -- or vice
        versa.
      "reduplicative": >-
        A category is marked by some kind of reduplication effect
      "tonal": >-
        A tone contrast marks a morphological contrast. The tone must be not be the result
        of a general phonological sandhi rule, but represent true internal tone changes.
      "concatenative_and_reduplicative": >-
        Concatenative formative plus reduplication (usually reduplication of stem). If
        some lexemes take just the affix and others take the affix plus the reduplication,
        choose Concat + redupl and code for lexeme-based formative flexivity. (The
        flexivity lies in whether they do or do not take the reduplication part.)
      "concatenative_and_ablaut": >-
        Concatenative formative plus ablaut (usually stem ablaut).
      "concatenative_or_ablaut": >-
        Concatenative formative or ablaut, neither one clearly primary (or both equally
        primary).
      "replacive": >-
        The formative replaces a stem (or theme or base) segment. This is different from
        regularly concatenative formatives which alternate with other formatives, and
        not with stem segments. Examples: Marxist derived from Marxism (-ism replaces
        -ist) (Spencer in Spencer & Zwicky, Handbook of Morphology, 140; Oxford, 1998).
        In Slavic hypocoristics, after truncation, the stem-final consonant is replaced
        with /x/, e.g. Russ. smex ‘laughter’ < smej- ‘laugh’.
      "prosodic_templatic": >-
        Superimposition of a syllable or foot template onto the stem, resulting in such
        processes as lengthening, gemination etc. Example: Lango alienable possesse
        marking, Semitic voice marking, etc.
      "isolating_then_concatenative": >-
        First part of the formative is isolating, second part is concatenative.
      "concatenative_then_isolating": >-
        First part of the formative is concatenative, second part is isolating.
      "tonal_or_ablaut_then_isolating": >-
        First part of the formative is a tonal or ablaut alternation; second part is
        isolating. Example: Kisi negation, where the verb stem undergoes tone changes and
        a particle is added (Childs, A Grammar of Kisi, 220ff.; Mouton de Gruyter 1995.
      "suppletive": >-
        One root or morpheme replaces another in part of a paradigm.
      "lenition": >-
        Alternation in one or more consonant features
      "ablaut": >-
        Alternation of stem segments in some grammatical context. Distinct from
        phonologically conditioned alternation.
      "concatenative_default_or_isolating": >-
        Concatenative formative is default; isolating allomorph under certain conditions.
      "isolating_default_or_concatenative": >-
        Isolating formative is default; concatenative allomorph under certain conditions.
      "mixed": >-
        This value is used only for survey purposes. Do not use when inputting data. When
        inputting data, choose a specific value or <?>.
      "distributed": >-
        There are realizational traces of the category on several or even all morphemes
        in a string, and none of these seem more basic (so that others could be analyzed
        as category-triggered allomorphs. Good example: Semitic root&pattern morphology,
        where for TAM+DIATHESIS values it seems abritrary to either take the stem ablaut
        or the affix form as basic. They code TAM+DIATHESIS simultaneously.
      "concatenative_or_suppletive": >-
        Concatenative formative or suppletion, under different conditions.
      "tonal_or_suppletive": >-
        Tonal formative or suppletion, under different conditions.
      "ablaut_or_suppletive": >-
        Ablaut or suppletion, under different conditions.
      "concatenative_or_tonal": >-
        Concatenative or tonal formative, under different conditions.
      "reduplicative_or_suppletive": >-
        Reduplication or suppletion, under different conditions.
      "ablaut_or_tonal": >-
        Ablaut or tone change, under different conditions.

        is dependent marking, but the dependent argument can be realized by agreement
        morphology on the head. If it is, it absorbs the argument position in the clause
        and therefore does not allow an independent NP to show up in the same clausal
        core.)
      "d on h": >-
        Headward-migrated dependent marking, restricted in some way. Typical cases:
        Bagirmi or standard French, where there is no case on independent pronouns
        and nouns, so only pronominal agreement markers are case-marked. As a result,
        arguments are differentiated only in headward-migrated dependent marking. This
        marking realizes the dependent argument syntactically and leaves no place for an
        independent NP to show up in the same clausal core.
      "h+d on h": >-
        Head marking (construct state type, i.e. registers a dependent but does not index
        its properties) plus headward-migrated dependent-marked pronouns
      "Hh+D": >-
        Two head marks (one restricted) plus one dependent.
      "H+d on h": >-
        Head marking (construct state type, i.e. registers a dependent but does not index
        its properties) plus headward-migrated dependent-marked pronouns
      "hh+d": >-
        Two restricted H markers and one restricted D marker.
      "H/D/DH": >-
        Split, e.g. inalienables take H or D+H, alienables take only D.
      "H/D": >-
        Split, either H or D.
      "D + D on H": >-
        Clitic doubling, where the argument is D-marked and is doubled by a D-marked
        pronominal on the verb.
      "f": >-
        Floating, under limited circumstances (e.g. Yagua DOM by floating agreement with
        definite noun)
      "H+F": >-
        Head plus floating
      "F+d": >-
        Floating plus restricted dependent marking.
      "H/F": >-
        Split, head or floating. E.g. Halkomelem (Galloway 1984:179): possessive 1sg is F,
        3sg is H.
      "H+": >-
        Possessor promoted to verb argument (external possession), and indexed or
        registered on verb. Example: Registered in Nez Perce (Rude, U. Ore. diss.
        1985:199ff.).

        Inert and at the end of its domain (e.g. at the end of the clause for TAM markers,
        or at the end of the NP for case markers)
      "initial": >-
        Inert and at the beginning (first element) of its domain (e.g. at the first
        element of the clause for TAM markers, or at the beginning of the NP for case
        markers). Combined with a “post” value in position, a “following” value in
        Placement, and freedom of hosts, this is a typical Wackernagel clitic.
      "on head": >-
        Inert and positioned on the head of its domain: V for TAM, N for case. This
        is typical for suffixes. Since clitics are typically insensitive to the host
        category, their placement is regulated by more abstract positions (initial, final,
        penultimate, pre-initial etc.) rather than the head. “On head” is used only with
        phrases where the head can vary its position.
      "on preceding": >-
        DO NOT USE ANYMORE. If an element precedes its host, e.g. if a case enclitic
        attaches to the preceding word, this is coded (following Klavans 1985) as
        placement = preceding and behavior = on head (or spreading or initial or whatever
        the case may be).
      "flexible": >-
        Inert and freely positioned within its domain (ie. position is not defined with
        respect to H or D but by something else).
      "lex. positioned": >-
        Once per phrase; whether on head or dependent is lexically determined. Example:
        Wemba Wemba dual and plural, which are overt on the noun unless there is a
        demonstrative pronoun; then it takes the dual or plural form and the noun does
        not.
      "on head and final": >-
        Simultaneously on head and final.
      "on head and initial": >-
        Simultaneously on head and initial.
      "on head or final": >-
        Data inconclusive because all heads in the grammar happen to be final.

        data: value-list
        values: 
          "A-default": >-
            Most agentive argument of (di)transitive verb. Includes experiencers as long
            as they are coded in the same way as agents. If they are coded like patients,
            they are treated as ‘A-exp’ here.
          "U-default": >-
            Most patientive argument of monotransitive verb. Includes ‘contents/stimuli’
            as long as they are coded in the same way as patients. If they are coded like
            agents, they are treated as ‘C’ here
          "S-default": >-
            Single argument of intransitive verb
          "Pat": >-
            Patientive argument irrespective of transitivity. Typical in active/stative
            systems, but often grammaticalized to a degree where ‘agentivity’ or ‘control’
            do no longer predict the distribution of the role.
          "T-default": >-
            Theme argument of ditransitives; corresponds to ‘secondary object’ in a
            language that conflates U and G.
          "B-default": >-
            beneficiary, goal, recipient argument of ditransitives; corresponds to
            ‘indirect object’ in a language that conflates U and T.
          "A-exp": >-
            Experiencers that behave like A but not entirely. Since this is a form
            class concept, it includes arguments that are ‘obliged’ in an obligation
            construction and possessors in dative possessor constructions (subspecies of
            A-obl). An experiencer is an A-exp only if it is thematically/topically more
            prominent than the stimulus; otherwise it is a plain Patient.
          "U-def": >-
            Definite U. Good example: accusative marked Turkish direct objects

          "S-d": >-
            Single argument in intransitives that are derived from transitives through
            (anti)passives and other detransitivizing morpholexical operations (only if
            the language makes a distinction between derived and non-derived S)
          "U-stim": >-
            stimuli that mostly but not entirely behave like the most patientive argument
            of transitive verbs
          "Act": >-
            volitional, agentive actors irrespective of transitivity. Typical in active/
            stative systems, but often grammaticalized to a degree where ‘agentivity’ or
            ‘control’ do no longer predict the distribution of the role.
          "core": >-
            any of S, A or U arguments
          "oblique": >-
            general oblique

            Pronominal A’s, including demonstratives. If the distinction is between
            personal pronouns and everything else it is more likely to have to with
            empathy (‘A-emp’)

            roles marked simultaneously; A acts on U; typical in inverse markers
          "POSS-default": >-
            Possessor: all genitival relations in an NP. Note: if a POSS marker is sused
            for indicating experience beyond literal possession (e.g. my-thirst/my-
            love is.there vs. literal my-leg/my-heart hurts) note this as A-exp (if with
            bivalent predicate) or as S-exp (if with a monovalent predicate)

            Experiencers that mostly behave like S but not entirely
          "E-default": >-
            Experiencer. Only if covering ALL experiencers as distinct from A’s. If only
            some experiencers are covered, the others being coded like agentive A’s, then

            Singular, plural, sometimes others. Other than in role agreement.
          "Role": >-
            Grammatical role or relation, including pivots
          "TAM": >-
            Tense, aspect, and mood
          "Honorificity": >-
            Categories used to differentiate status of individuals: the referent of a form
            marked as honorific is higher in status than the other(s) in the discourse.
          "Aspect": >-
            Grammatical aspect, sensitive to lexical Aktionsart and implicated in syntax;
            categories such as perfective and imperfective.
          "Polarity": >-
            Negative vs. Affirmative
          "Nominalizer": >-
            Derives a syntactic noun form from a verb; turns a clause into a phrase that

          "Tense": >-
            The traditional category of time reference (absolute or relative) in verbs.
          "Connective": >-
            Marker of clause connection, including chaining markers, complementizers,
            markers of subordination or relative (unless it is a nominalizer, in
            which case code as Nominalizer). Includes converbs of all types, chaining
            (narrative, sequencing) and subordinating (adverbial). Forms called
            “subjunctive” or “conjunctive” are likely to belong here.
          "Causative": >-
            Adds an agent to the valence.
          "Voice": >-
            Assignment of role to an NP with a certain marker or status (nominative,
            absolutive, etc.) with a reduction in syntactic transitivity. This includes
            passives, antipassives, diathetic reflexives, middles etc.
          "Version": >-
            Category that registers the presence of an indirect object, goal, or
            applicative object and responds to its person (typically distinguishing 1st/
            2nd vs. 3rd person). Term and concept from Kartvelian languages.
          "Semistem": >-
            The more wordlike or noun-like element of a bipartite stem that interacts with
            the inflectional system.
          "Gender": >-
            Agreement category involving noun classification. Usually covert on nouns;
            overt on agreeing word(s). Unless otherwise specified this is lexical gender
            of nouns.
          "Quantificational": >-
            Multiple argument or multiple action, variously or fluidly. Pluractionals,
            distributive, ‘each’, ‘all’, ‘some’, ‘once’, ‘always’, ‘repeatedly’ etc.
            Subsumes both argument and event quantification
          "MAN": >-
            Mood-Aspect-Negation (term from Heath 1999 [Koyra Chiini]).

          "MTN": >-
            Mood, tense, and negation
          "Direction": >-
            Direct/inverse marking, indicating conformity vs. non-conformity to a
            hierarchy (person, referentiality), whether using equipollent direct and
            inverse markers (e.g. Cree) or only an inverse marker (e.g. Chukchi).
          "Reflexive": >-
            Reflexives unless they serve purely diathetic purposes (passives,
            antipassives)
          "Focus": >-
            intensifiers, focus, emphatics etc.
          "Valence": >-
            Transitivity markers. Does not include diathetical markers whose primary
            function is to change valence. Valence markers as defined here are generally
            used on ALL transitive or ALL intransitive verbs, whether derived or not
            (Example; Algonquian, Austronesian transitivity markers). But note that
            obviation is covered under Referential.
          "Evidential": >-
            Evidentials, miratives, evaluatives, etc.
          "PossClass": >-
            Possessive declension class, i.e. declension class based on possessum=head
          "Construct": >-
            The formative does not express any category but rather indicates the use of
            a certain construction or the presence of a certain syntactic configuration.
            Examples: Arabic or Slave construct state marking
          "PossSem": >-
            Possession semantics (e.g. marking that the head is alienable or drinkable
            or whatever) -- not to be used if the marking is due to possessive declension
            class differences!
          "Sex": >-
            Natural gender. Sex of referent (e.g. in English pronouns). For gender
            classification of nouns, code as gender (even if gender is predictable from
            sex, as it usually is for animates).
          "Referential": >-
            Values like definite, indefinite, specific, nonspecific, generic, obviative,
            proximative, remote, etc. NB: “Referential” is exponent of CASE only if the
            referential value cannot be separated from the syntactic role that the CASE
            marker codes. That is, with Tagalog ANG, for example, you cannot have the
            syntactic role that ANG codes without at the same time having specific NP
            reference. This is different from DOM (and DSM) in Turkish or Hindi or Spanish
            because not marking the object by the ACC does not make it an object any less.
            Unmarked O’s in DOM systems are O’s. But not using ANG because the NP doesn’t
            have specific reference, changes the syntactic role the NP is in.
          "Switch_reference": >-
            Grammatical category tracking successive clauses in a discourse for whether
            the subject (or other pivot) is referentially identical to vs. different from
            that of the adjacent clause.
          "Status": >-
            Realis vs. irrealis; certainty
          "TE": >-
            Tense and evidentiality together
          "Aktionsart": >-
            Situation aspect, or lexical aspect.
          "Potentialis": >-
            Potential mood category.
          "Classifier": >-
            Formative that classifies any argument, regardless of the type of
            classification (e.g. shape, body part) or whether the classifier itself
            is incorporated or just its semantics is specified. If numeral classifiers
            are incorporated into the verb, include that here regardless of whether the
            classified noun is also incorporated with it.
          "Mood": >-
            General term for mood categories such as indicative, conditional, subjunctive,
            imperative, etc.
          "Reflexive_and_Reciprocal": >-
            Reflexive and/or reciprocal, for languages in which these two are non-distinct
            or in complementary distribution.
          "RECIP": >-
            Reciprocal
          "MSE": >-
            Mood or Status or Evidential or any combination of these
          "AN Focus": >-
            DO NOT USE. Use 72 instead. (Was: Western Austronesian-style focus marking.)
          "Scope": >-
            The category serves to indicate or constrain the scope of some other morpheme
            (e.g negation).
          "Modality": >-
            Possibility, probability, etc.; also desiderative, intention.
          "Deixis": >-
            Any grammatical category distinguishing direction toward vs. from speaker,
            or similar; also up (from speaker), down (from speaker). Common terms:
            cislocative, translocative.
          "Possessor": >-
            The adnominal, or dependent, member of adnominal constructions (NP with
            modifier or adjunct). Includes but is not limited to literal possessors.
          "Motion": >-
            Inflectional categories (other than deixis) that have to do with motion, e.g.
            Yagua unbounded movement suffix, Mparntwe Arrernte associated motion. But see
            also Purposive.
          "Repetition": >-
