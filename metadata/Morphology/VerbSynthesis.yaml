  Various aspects of how verbs forms can be structured in a language, such
  as presence of incorporation and inflectional categories (including agreement)
  expressed on maximally inflected verbs etc. These are high-level
  per-language aggregations, not individual verb forms.
  
  *Caution*: the fields `IsVerbAgreementSurveyComplete` and `IsVerbInflectionSurveyComplete` specify
  whether the data in `VerbAgreement` and `VerbInflectionCategories` is exhaustively coded.
  Do not rely on entries where these flags are FALSE.

        description: >-
          Inflectional categories that can be marked separately on a maximally
          inflected verb form and that have at least one overt reflex in the
          form. When categories are cumulated or semantically conflated
          in a single marker (as is often case with tense, aspect and mood),
          they are counted as a single composite category (e.g. TAM); therefore
          separate listing of categories entails that they are marked separately
          and are clearly distinguishable. Categories are only coded if they
          have at least one overt morphological reflex in the form (e.g.
          'active' is not a category of English synthetic verb forms even though
          such forms are in opposition to a passive construction). Also see
          Bickel & Nichols' chapter on synthesis in the World Atlas of Language
          Structure (wals.info).
        kind: manual data entry
        data: value-list
        values: 
          "Person": >-
            1st, 2nd, 3rd person (and sometimes others), i.e. noun or pronoun referents
            defined as speaker/hearer/neither.
          "Number": >-
            Singular, plural, sometimes others. Other than in role agreement.
          "Role": >-
            Grammatical role or relation, including pivots
          "TAM": >-
            Tense, aspect, and mood
          "Honorificity": >-
            Categories used to differentiate status of individuals: the referent of a form
            marked as honorific is higher in status than the other(s) in the discourse.
          "Aspect": >-
            Grammatical aspect, sensitive to lexical Aktionsart and implicated in syntax;
            categories such as perfective and imperfective.
          "Polarity": >-
            Negative vs. Affirmative
          "Nominalizer": >-
            Derives a syntactic noun form from a verb; turns a clause into a phrase that
            can function as argument or possessor.
          "Tense": >-
            The traditional category of time reference (absolute or relative) in verbs.
          "Connective": >-
            Marker of clause connection, including chaining markers, complementizers,
            markers of subordination or relative (unless it is a nominalizer, in
            which case code as Nominalizer). Includes converbs of all types, chaining
            (narrative, sequencing) and subordinating (adverbial). Forms called
            “subjunctive” or “conjunctive” are likely to belong here.
          "Causative": >-
            Adds an agent to the valence.
          "Voice": >-
            Assignment of role to an NP with a certain marker or status (nominative,
            absolutive, etc.) with a reduction in syntactic transitivity. This includes
            passives, antipassives, diathetic reflexives, middles etc.
          "Version": >-
            Category that registers the presence of an indirect object, goal, or
            applicative object and responds to its person (typically distinguishing 1st/
            2nd vs. 3rd person). Term and concept from Kartvelian languages.
          "Semistem": >-
            The more wordlike or noun-like element of a bipartite stem that interacts with
            the inflectional system.
          "Gender": >-
            Agreement category involving noun classification. Usually covert on nouns;
            overt on agreeing word(s). Unless otherwise specified this is lexical gender
            of nouns.
          "Quantificational": >-
            Multiple argument or multiple action, variously or fluidly. Pluractionals,
            distributive, ‘each’, ‘all’, ‘some’, ‘once’, ‘always’, ‘repeatedly’ etc.
            Subsumes both argument and event quantification
          "MAN": >-
            Mood-Aspect-Negation (term from Heath 1999 [Koyra Chiini]).
          "TA": >-
            Tense-aspect
          "Applicative": >-
            Adds another object to the valence.
          "Illocution": >-
            Interrogative, Declarative, Imperative etc.
          "MTN": >-
            Mood, tense, and negation
          "Direction": >-
            Direct/inverse marking, indicating conformity vs. non-conformity to a
            hierarchy (person, referentiality), whether using equipollent direct and
            inverse markers (e.g. Cree) or only an inverse marker (e.g. Chukchi).
          "Reflexive": >-
            Reflexives unless they serve purely diathetic purposes (passives,
            antipassives)
          "Focus": >-
            intensifiers, focus, emphatics etc.
          "Valence": >-
            Transitivity markers. Does not include diathetical markers whose primary
            function is to change valence. Valence markers as defined here are generally
            used on ALL transitive or ALL intransitive verbs, whether derived or not
            (Example; Algonquian, Austronesian transitivity markers). But note that
            obviation is covered under Referential.
          "Evidential": >-
            Evidentials, miratives, evaluatives, etc.
          "PossClass": >-
            Possessive declension class, i.e. declension class based on possessum=head
          "Construct": >-
            The formative does not express any category but rather indicates the use of
            a certain construction or the presence of a certain syntactic configuration.
            Examples: Arabic or Slave construct state marking
          "PossSem": >-
            Possession semantics (e.g. marking that the head is alienable or drinkable
            or whatever) -- not to be used if the marking is due to possessive declension
            class differences!
          "Sex": >-
            Natural gender. Sex of referent (e.g. in English pronouns). For gender
            classification of nouns, code as gender (even if gender is predictable from
            sex, as it usually is for animates).
          "Referential": >-
            Values like definite, indefinite, specific, nonspecific, generic, obviative,
            proximative, remote, etc. NB: “Referential” is exponent of CASE only if the
            referential value cannot be separated from the syntactic role that the CASE
            marker codes. That is, with Tagalog ANG, for example, you cannot have the
            syntactic role that ANG codes without at the same time having specific NP
            reference. This is different from DOM (and DSM) in Turkish or Hindi or Spanish
            because not marking the object by the ACC does not make it an object any less.
            Unmarked O’s in DOM systems are O’s. But not using ANG because the NP doesn’t
            have specific reference, changes the syntactic role the NP is in.
          "Switch_reference": >-
            Grammatical category tracking successive clauses in a discourse for whether
            the subject (or other pivot) is referentially identical to vs. different from
            that of the adjacent clause.
          "Status": >-
            Realis vs. irrealis; certainty
          "TE": >-
            Tense and evidentiality together
          "Aktionsart": >-
            Situation aspect, or lexical aspect.
          "Potentialis": >-
            Potential mood category.
          "Classifier": >-
            Formative that classifies any argument, regardless of the type of
            classification (e.g. shape, body part) or whether the classifier itself
            is incorporated or just its semantics is specified. If numeral classifiers
            are incorporated into the verb, include that here regardless of whether the
            classified noun is also incorporated with it.
          "Mood": >-
            General term for mood categories such as indicative, conditional, subjunctive,
            imperative, etc.
          "Reflexive_and_Reciprocal": >-
            Reflexive and/or reciprocal, for languages in which these two are non-distinct
            or in complementary distribution.
          "RECIP": >-
            Reciprocal
          "MSE": >-
            Mood or Status or Evidential or any combination of these
          "AN Focus": >-
            DO NOT USE. Use 72 instead. (Was: Western Austronesian-style focus marking.)
          "Scope": >-
            The category serves to indicate or constrain the scope of some other morpheme
            (e.g negation).
          "Modality": >-
            Possibility, probability, etc.; also desiderative, intention.
          "Deixis": >-
            Any grammatical category distinguishing direction toward vs. from speaker,
            or similar; also up (from speaker), down (from speaker). Common terms:
            cislocative, translocative.
          "Possessor": >-
            The adnominal, or dependent, member of adnominal constructions (NP with
            modifier or adjunct). Includes but is not limited to literal possessors.
          "Motion": >-
            Inflectional categories (other than deixis) that have to do with motion, e.g.
            Yagua unbounded movement suffix, Mparntwe Arrernte associated motion. But see
            also Purposive.
          "Repetition": >-
            Iteration, repetition (‘again’); not the same as an iterative Aktionsart.
          "Posterior": >-
            Action follows another. May be future-like in elicitation. This definition
            based on the Hatam posterior category.
          "Rich_Construct": >-
            Construct marker, but with additional semantics indicating something about the
            role or function of the relevant dependent. See the Hatam instrument prefix
            for an example.
          "Present": >-
            True present or Current Relevance (defined for Jeli [Mande, Ivory Coast] by
            Tröbs 1998: 141-2): makes a verb present or perfect.
          "TM": >-
            Tense and mood
          "Quotative": >-
            Reported speech, quotative, and other dedicated markers of direct, indirect,
            or semidirect speech.
          "Possessive": >-
            Possessive morphology (often affix), usually dependent-driven agreement on
            head.
          "Sequential": >-
            Sequenced or sequential actions (anterior or posterior relative tense). Maybe
            this category should be conflated with future/posterior.
          "Conditional": >-
            Mood category marking conditionality in any sense (hypothetical,
            counterfactual, etc.).
          "MA": >-
            Mood and aspect
          "Case": >-
            E.g. Kunwinjku inflected verbs can take a case suffix; makes the verb
            (approximately) an adverbial clause (‘when’, etc.).
          "Control": >-
            As in Salishan: deliberate, involuntary, etc. control of A over the action.
          "Topic": >-
            Either sentential topic (what is talked about in a sentence, opposed to
            comment) or discourse topic (central participant of a stretch of discourse).
          "Taxis": >-
            Converb, participle, etc. morphology that can expand a fully inflected verb
            form
          "Progressive": >-
            Aktionsart category involving bounded duration.
          "Clusivity": >-
            inclusive/exclusive
          "Spatial": >-
            Various local, spatial, etc. things (other than Deixis).
          "Symmetrical_voice": >-
            Assignment of role to an NP with a certain marker or status (proximate, topic,
            focus, etc.) without a change in syntactic transitivity. This includes systems
            such as Western Austronesian focus, Yukagir focus, Algonquian obviation, etc.
          "Distributive": >-
            Multiple occurrences of an argument, separate from role marking and distinct
            from number marking
          "Reversative": >-

          "Unspecified_Argument": >-
            Unspecified or generic (or similar) A, O, etc.
          "Middle": >-
            Middle voice. This is probably lexical or derivational, not inflectional.
          "Incompletive": >-
            Incompletive aspect.
          "Purposive": >-
            (Term used for Tariana and used as though it were a standard term. Means ‘go
            and ...’, ‘(in order) for ... to...’. Consider changing to Modality.
          "TAME": >-
            TAM and evidential, all in one slot
          "Affect": >-
            Indicates that an argument (e.g. A) is affected by, or has an interest in, the
            event.

        kind: manual data entry
        data: value-list
        values: 
          "A-default": >-
            Most agentive argument of (di)transitive verb. Includes experiencers as long
            as they are coded in the same way as agents. If they are coded like patients,
            they are treated as ‘A-exp’ here.
          "U-default": >-
            Most patientive argument of monotransitive verb. Includes ‘contents/stimuli’
            as long as they are coded in the same way as patients. If they are coded like
            agents, they are treated as ‘C’ here
          "S-default": >-
            Single argument of intransitive verb
          "Pat": >-
            Patientive argument irrespective of transitivity. Typical in active/stative
            systems, but often grammaticalized to a degree where ‘agentivity’ or ‘control’
            do no longer predict the distribution of the role.
          "T-default": >-
            Theme argument of ditransitives; corresponds to ‘secondary object’ in a
            language that conflates U and G.
          "B-default": >-
            beneficiary, goal, recipient argument of ditransitives; corresponds to
            ‘indirect object’ in a language that conflates U and T.
          "A-exp": >-
            Experiencers that behave like A but not entirely. Since this is a form
            class concept, it includes arguments that are ‘obliged’ in an obligation
            construction and possessors in dative possessor constructions (subspecies of
            A-obl). An experiencer is an A-exp only if it is thematically/topically more
            prominent than the stimulus; otherwise it is a plain Patient.
          "U-def": >-
            Definite U. Good example: accusative marked Turkish direct objects
          "T-def": >-
            Definite T. Good example: accusative marked Turkish direct objects
          "U-emp": >-
            U with high empathy/animacy. Good example: Spanish a, Indo-Iranian datives
          "T-emp": >-
            U with high empathy/animacy. Good example: Spanish a, Indo-Iranian datives
          "A-anim": >-
            Transitive actors that are animate
          "G-default": >-
            Goal of motion verbs
          "<any>": >-
            any role depending on the syntactic environment
          "S-d": >-
            Single argument in intransitives that are derived from transitives through
            (anti)passives and other detransitivizing morpholexical operations (only if
            the language makes a distinction between derived and non-derived S)
          "U-stim": >-
            stimuli that mostly but not entirely behave like the most patientive argument
            of transitive verbs
          "Act": >-
            volitional, agentive actors irrespective of transitivity. Typical in active/
            stative systems, but often grammaticalized to a degree where ‘agentivity’ or
            ‘control’ do no longer predict the distribution of the role.
          "core": >-
            any of S, A or U arguments
          "oblique": >-
            general oblique
          "O-adp": >-
            object of adposition
          "A-pro": >-
            Pronominal A’s, including demonstratives. If the distinction is between
            personal pronouns and everything else it is more likely to have to with
            empathy (‘A-emp’)
          "U-com": >-
            comitative object of applicative
          "U-loc": >-
            locative object of applicative
          "U-circ": >-
            circumstantial object of applicative
          "U-instr": >-
            instrumental object of applicative
          "U-nom": >-

            Recipients of ditransitives if formally distinct from recipients and goals
          "A-poss": >-
            Possessor (in clause construction translatable with ‘have’).
          "A>U": >-
            roles marked simultaneously; A acts on U; typical in inverse markers
          "POSS-default": >-
            Possessor: all genitival relations in an NP. Note: if a POSS marker is sused
            for indicating experience beyond literal possession (e.g. my-thirst/my-
            love is.there vs. literal my-leg/my-heart hurts) note this as A-exp (if with
            bivalent predicate) or as S-exp (if with a monovalent predicate)
          "S-exp": >-
            Experiencers that mostly behave like S but not entirely
          "E-default": >-
            Experiencer. Only if covering ALL experiencers as distinct from A’s. If only
            some experiencers are covered, the others being coded like agentive A’s, then
            this is coded as ‘A-exp’
          "U-ref": >-
            Referential object,i.e. all arguments except those that refer to generic kinds
          "U-pro": >-
            Incorporated pronoun (can’t co-occur with co-referential overt object NP in

          "S-nom": >-
            S in the unmarked (nominative) case
          "AFF": >-

            possessors etc.
          "U-disamb": >-
            U in the presence of an unmarked A; if the A is case-marked, U is not also
            case-marked. Example: Rapanui Accusative
          "POSS-def": >-
