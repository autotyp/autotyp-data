    'h+D' : >
       Dependent marking is dominant. Additional head marking with some verbs only or under specific
       morphosyntactic conditions as noted.
    'Dd' : >
       Same as DD but with the additional formative or category restricted to some possessors only (e.g.
       pronouns only: German; contrast Hindi, where all possessors show head-driven agreement)
    'h' : >
       Head marking that is available only on a limited set of NPs or under specific morphosyntactic
       conditions as noted.
    'd on h' : >
       Headward-migrated dependent marking, restricted in some way. Typical cases: Bagirmi or standard
       French, where there is no case on independent pronouns and nouns, so only pronominal agreement
       markers are case-marked. As a result, arguments are differentiated only in headward-migrated dependent
       marking. This marking realizes the dependent argument syntactically and leaves no place for an
       independent NP to show up in the same clausal core.
    'd' : >
       Dependent marking that is available only on a limited set of NPs or under specific morphosyntactic
       conditions as noted.
    'H/D' : >
       Split, either H or D.
    'D on H' : >
       Headward-migrated dependent marking. Typical case: Arabic or Irish pronominal agreement, where
       nouns and independent pronouns are case-marked. (The case itself is dependent marking, but the
       dependent argument can be realized by agreement morphology on the head. If it is, it absorbs the
       argument position in the clause and therefore does not allow an independent NP to show up in the
       same clausal core.)
    'F' : >
       Free or floating, including particles or similar in phrase-second position (Wackernagel position),
       e.g. Tagalog ‘linkers’
    'hh' : >
       On head, with more than one formative or more than one category, but both formatives have restricted
       distribution.
    'H/D/DH' : >
       Split, e.g. inalienables take H or D+H, alienables take only D.
    'f' : >
       Floating, under limited circumstances (e.g. Yagua DOM by floating agreement with definite noun)
    'H+d' : >
       Head marking is dominant. Additional dependent marking with some NPs or under specific morphosyntactic
       conditions as noted.
    'H/F' : >
       Split, head or floating. E.g. Halkomelem (Galloway 1984:179): possessive 1sg is F, 3sg is H.
