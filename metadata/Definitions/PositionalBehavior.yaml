      Positional behavior of a grammatical marker in its phrase, as defined in

      ed. T. Shopen, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press)
    kind: manual data entry
    data: value-list
    values: 
      "inert": >-
        Not spreading, not stacking. Default for non-phrasal elements.
      "spreading": >-
        See Bickel & Nichols, ‘Inflectional morphology’ in Shopen ed., Language Typology
        and Syntactic Description (CUP 2007)
      "stacking": >-
        See Bickel & Nichols, ‘Inflectional morphology’ in Shopen ed., Language Typology
        and Syntactic Description, (CUP 2007)
      "final": >-
        Inert and at the end of its domain (e.g. at the end of the clause for TAM markers,
        or at the end of the NP for case markers)
      "initial": >-
        Inert and at the beginning (first element) of its domain (e.g. at the first
        element of the clause for TAM markers, or at the beginning of the NP for case
        markers). Combined with a “post” value in position, a “following” value in
        Placement, and freedom of hosts, this is a typical Wackernagel clitic.
      "on head": >-
        Inert and positioned on the head of its domain: V for TAM, N for case. This
        is typical for suffixes. Since clitics are typically insensitive to the host
        category, their placement is regulated by more abstract positions (initial, final,
        penultimate, pre-initial etc.) rather than the head. “On head” is used only with
        phrases where the head can vary its position.
      "on preceding": >-
        DO NOT USE ANYMORE. If an element precedes its host, e.g. if a case enclitic
        attaches to the preceding word, this is coded (following Klavans 1985) as
        placement = preceding and behavior = on head (or spreading or initial or whatever
        the case may be).
      "flexible": >-
        Inert and freely positioned within its domain (ie. position is not defined with
        respect to H or D but by something else).
      "lex. positioned": >-
        Once per phrase; whether on head or dependent is lexically determined. Example:
        Wemba Wemba dual and plural, which are overt on the noun unless there is a
        demonstrative pronoun; then it takes the dual or plural form and the noun does
        not.
      "on head and final": >-
        Simultaneously on head and final.
      "on head and initial": >-
        Simultaneously on head and initial.
      "on head or final": >-
        Data inconclusive because all heads in the grammar happen to be final.
