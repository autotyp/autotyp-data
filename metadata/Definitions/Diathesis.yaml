      Diathesis
    kind: manual data entry
    data: value-list
    values: 
      "<any>": >-
        any diathesis
      "ACT": >-
        basic diathesis. in languages where it is possible to identify one, corresponds to
        active in case of active-passive/antipassive alternations
      "promP & demA": >-
        a (mostly derived) diathesis with A demotion and P promotion (acquiring certain
        properties of the S argument)
      "promA & demP": >-
        a (mostly derived) diathesis with the A argument acquiring certain properties of
        the S argument. and the P argument loosing such properties
      "?": >-
        unclear. needs revision
      "n.a.": >-
        not applicable
      "sympromA": >-
        a symmetrical diathesis with the A argument sharing certain morpho-syntactic
        properties with the S argument. For Philippine-type languages. the so-called
        Actor-Focus diathesis (cf. Schachter & Otanes 1972).
      "sympromP": >-
        a symmetrical diathesis with the P (and T or G) argument sharing certain
        morpho-syntactic properties with the S argument. For Philippine-type languages.
        the so-called Object-Focus diathesis (Schachter & Otanes 1972)
      "sympromG": >-
        a symmetrical diathesis with the G argument sharing certain morpho-syntactic
        properties with the S argument. For Philippine-type languages. the so-called
        Directional-Focus diathesis (Schachter & Otanes 1972)
      "sympromADJ": >-
        a symmetrical diathesis with an adjunct (non-argument) sharing certain
        morpho-syntactic properties with the S argument.
      "DIR": >-
        direct
      "INV": >-
        inverse
      "demA": >-
        a (mostly derived) diathesis with A demotion
      "scenario-bound": >-
        scenario-conditioned diathesis. provisionally introduced to account for cases
        including INV/DIR distribution and symmetrical voice of the Tagalog type i.e.
        cases where in a particular constellation of argument only one diathesis is
        possible
