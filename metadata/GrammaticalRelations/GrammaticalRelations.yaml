  Detailed coding of grammatical relations as selectors of generalized semantic roles,
  conditioned by various parameters (https://www.autotyp.uzh.ch/projects/grhandbook/GR_Quest.pdf).
  
  Note: this is a processed and validated dataset, generated from complete data in
  `GrammaticalRelationsRaw` (`IsSelectorSurveyComplete==TRUE`). We currently include GR data on
  case marking and agreement only, with default diathesis and semantic/syntactic domain condition.

  Language:
    description: >-
      In this database a language is actually a dialect or variety, in that
      individual dialects are entered as languages. That is, each language has
      its own ID number (the 'LID') distinct from that of the pan-dialectal
      language:e.g. LID 87 German, 1227 Upper Austrian German, 1295 Berlin
      German, 1310 Zürich German, 2845 Old High German, etc. (The pan-dialectal
      language is identified as the lowest taxonomic level, the `dialect group',
      but this information is incomplete in many areas and has not been included
      in the current release.) The general criterion for a separate language
      record in the database is that it has a distinct property in at least one
      of the typological variables that we survey; this may or may not coincide
      with sociolinguistic criteria.

  SelectorType:
    description: >-
      A (cross-linguistic) morphosyntactic pattern type that encompasses
      multiple specific argument selectors and organises them into groups such
      as dependent marking selectors (i.e. in- dividual case and adposition
      markers). This is the type of the grammatical relation. Alignment patterns
      arise from comparing argument selectors that belong to the same group
      (e.g. "nominative/accusative case marking alignment" implies that there
      are two selectors of dependent marking type, one of which selects roles
      S and A and another selects the role P). See Witzlack 2011.  Typological
      variation in grammatical relations for more information.

  SelectorLabel:
