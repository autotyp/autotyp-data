  Language:
    description: >-
      In this database a language is actually a dialect or variety, in that
      individual dialects are entered as languages. That is, each language has
      its own ID number (the 'LID') distinct from that of the pan-dialectal
      language:e.g. LID 87 German, 1227 Upper Austrian German, 1295 Berlin
      German, 1310 ZÃ¼rich German, 2845 Old High German, etc. (The pan-dialectal
      language is identified as the lowest taxonomic level, the `dialect group',
      but this information is incomplete in many areas and has not been included
      in the current release.) The general criterion for a separate language
      record in the database is that it has a distinct property in at least one
      of the typological variables that we survey; this may or may not coincide
      with sociolinguistic criteria.
