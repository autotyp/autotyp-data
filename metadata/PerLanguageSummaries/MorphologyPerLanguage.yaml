  Language:
    description: >-
      In this database a language is actually a dialect or variety, in that
      individual dialects are entered as languages. That is, each language has
      its own ID number (the 'LID') distinct from that of the pan-dialectal
      language:e.g. LID 87 German, 1227 Upper Austrian German, 1295 Berlin
      German, 1310 ZÃ¼rich German, 2845 Old High German, etc. (The pan-dialectal
      language is identified as the lowest taxonomic level, the `dialect group',
      but this information is incomplete in many areas and has not been included
      in the current release.) The general criterion for a separate language
      record in the database is that it has a distinct property in at least one
      of the typological variables that we survey; this may or may not coincide
      with sociolinguistic criteria.

  HasAnyVerbAgreement:
    description: >-
        Presence of any type of verb agreement as indicated by the records in 
        MaximallyInflectedVerbSynthesis, LocusOfMarkingPerMicrorelation and GrammaticalRelations.
        This aggregated variable will be set to TRUE if any of the mentioned data sets describe any 
        type of agreement. If will be set to FALSE if none of the mentioned data sets describe any
        type of agreement. Finally, it will be set to NA (missing value) if none of the mentioned
        data sets have data on the language.
