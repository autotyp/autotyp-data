  This module tracks information on genealogical, geographical and other aspects of language
  classification. It was previously released as [Nichols et al. (2013)](https://www.autotyp.uzh.ch/download/release_2013/autotyp-release_2013.pdf).
  There are three main data components:
  
  - IDs: apart from our own unique language identifier (LID), the database is matched to Glottolog
  and ISO codes.
  
  - Genealogical information: The genealogy part is based on the state of the art in each family.
  We stay away from geographical groupings, widely mentioned but unproven groupings, or similar
  hypothetical groupings. (In the few cases where we felt it necessary to include a label for a
  residual grouping that is not a clade, such as Western Malayo-Polynesian, we have included
  'non-clade' in the name of the group.) Thus, our genealogy is similar to the classifications
  of Campbell & Poser (2008) or Glottolog, but does not attempt to include languages or families
  for which there is classificatory information but little or no typological information (e.g.
  Beothuk, Cayuse) and does not include languages with typological information available that
  happen not to be in our database. The genealogical database uses two classificatory levels (and
  corresponding database fields) that are cross-linguistically comparable: Language and Stock, as
  defined in the metadata. Between these two levels, the database provides various nested
  convenience levels that reflect the current state of the art in subgrouping research. They are
  not comparable across families (e.g. what is called a major branch can reflect a primary split
  in one but later splits in another family). Also, they are not necessarily complete.
  
  - Geographical information: The geography database contains information on the geographical
  location of languages and a small-scale and a large-scale classification of languages into
  areas. The area classifications are based on our assumptions about contact events in history,
  informed by current knowledge of the historical, genetic, anthropological, and archeological
  record. We try to keep our definition of areas free of linguistic information in order to avoid
  circularity in areal linguistics research (Bickel & Nichols 2006). The individual definitions
  are given in the metadata and illustrated in static area and continent pictures.
  
  - Other information: This contains information on the genesis (creole vs. regular) and modality
  (spoken vs. signed) of languages, and on the main subsistence of their speakers.

  Language:
    description: >-
      In this database a language is actually a dialect or variety, in that
      individual dialects are entered as languages. That is, each language has
      its own ID number (the 'LID') distinct from that of the pan-dialectal
      language:e.g. LID 87 German, 1227 Upper Austrian German, 1295 Berlin
      German, 1310 Zürich German, 2845 Old High German, etc. (The pan-dialectal
      language is identified as the lowest taxonomic level, the `dialect group',
      but this information is incomplete in many areas and has not been included
      in the current release.) The general criterion for a separate language
      record in the database is that it has a distinct property in at least one
      of the typological variables that we survey; this may or may not coincide
      with sociolinguistic criteria.

  Stock:
    description: >-
      Highest-level language family that satisfies the two criteria of
      demonstrability and reconstructability. A grouping is demonstrable
      if there is evidence showing that it is a family, or its resemblances
      significantly exceed what can be expected by chance or from typological
      or universal principles. It is reconstructable if it exhibits recurrent
      sound correspondences so that reconstruction is possible in principle.
      (For this definition of the stock see Nichols in Ann. Rev. Anth. 1997)
      Stocks do not all have the same internal age. Note that every isolate,
      every unclassified language, every creole, and every sign language in our
      database counts as a separate stock.

        northern shore of the Black Sea and the Carpathians to the Baltic sea. Also
        includes the languages of Ancient Anatolia and Mesopotamia east to the Hindu Kush
        (including the Iranian plateau).
      "N-C Asia": >-
        Northern and Central Asia. Siberia, the Tibetan plateau, Mongolia, Korea, and
        Japan.
      "S/SE Asia": >-
        South and Southeast Asia. The Indic subcontinent (including the Himalayas, but not
        the Tibetan plateau), mainland Southeast Asia, and insular Southeast Asia up to
        the Wallace Line (between Sumbawa and Flores).
      "Australia": >-

      "NG and Oceania": >-
        New Guinea and Oceania (all islands east of the Wallace Line).
      "W N America": >-
        Western North America. From the Pacific coast (excluding the Aleutian islands,

        regions. The southern boundary of North America runs along the US/Mexican border.
      "E N America": >-
        Eastern North America. From the lower eastern slope of the Cascades and Rocky
        Mountains to the Atlantic coast (thus comprising the Great Plains and eastern US
        and Canada). The southern boundary runs along the US/Mexican border; perhaps this
        boundary should eventually be placed at the northern limit of the Mesoamerican
        cultural area.
      "C America": >-
        Central America. The southern boundary is the Panama Canal; the northern boundary
        is the U.S.-Mexico border. Perhaps this boundary should eventually be placed at
        the northern limit of the Mesoamerican cultural area.

      events in history, informed by current knowledge of the historical,
      genetic, anthropological, and archeological record. See [figures/areas.jpg](figures/areas.jpg)
      for the visual area breakdown.
    kind: manual data entry
    data: value-list
    values: 
      "Alaska-Oregon": >-
        Western North America from the coast up to the crest of the major coastal range
        and from mainland Alaska (not including the Aleutian Islands in the Bering Sea)
        through the Pacific Northwest down to southern Coos Bay (43° N).
      "Basin and Plains": >-
        The southwestern desert and semidesert and the prairie, extending into interior
        northern Canada. The southern extent needs to be defined; Coahuiltec (which
        straddles the Texas-Mexico border) has for now been put in this area. Approximate
        eastern boundary: line from Matamoros/Brownsville or Houston to the Mississippi
        delta and up the Mississippi to its headwaters, then to the eastern Rocky
        Mountains foothills at about 58° N. The western boundary runs along the crest of
        the major coast range (Sierra Nevada, Cascades), so the area includes the old east
        slope riverine and lacustrine environment and its immediate periphery.
      "California": >-
        Defined culturally as the area where acorns were the main basis of the economy.
        Eastern boundary: the crest of the Sierras. Northern boundary: Coos Bay (latitude
        43° N). Otherwise congruent with the state of California.
      "Greater Mesopotamia": >-
        Anatolia, Caucasus, Near East, Mesopotamia, and Iran. From the northern limits
        of the Black and Caspian seas south to ancient Anatolia (modern Turkey) and
        Mesopotamia and the Iranian Plateau. Includes the Arabian peninsula.
      "E North America": >-
        Southeast and Eastern North America. The Gulf Coast and eastern woodlands. East of
        a line from Brownsville/Matamoros at the Mexico/US border to the Mississippi delta
        and up the Mississippi to its headwaters; from there to about Fort Nelson (58° N,
        122° W).
      "NE South America": >-
        The northeast of South America. From the eastern slope of the Andes to the
        Caribbean and Atlantic coasts (between Caracas and Port of Spain), south to 18° S
        (this is an arbitrary demarcation of the Amazon and La Plata drainages).
      "Europe": >-
        Europe up to the Eurasian steppe. Starting from the Black Sea, the eastern border
        of Europe follows the eastern slopes of the Carpathian mountains up to about
        the 22° E and then follows the Wisla up to the Baltic See; and from there we
        draw a straight line north. (This puts Poland inside Europe, based on its tight
        historical interaction with the rest of Europe; but one could as well draw the
        limit following the Oder-Elbe line.)
      "Inner Asia": >-
        Inner Siberia and Central Asia: western Turkestan and Afghanistan but not the
        Iranian plateau, and also the Eastern Eurasian steppe up to the Carpathians; the
        Tibetan Plateau; Mongolia (inner and outer); most of Siberia.
      "Indic": >-
        The Indic subcontinent. Extends to the eastern border of the Iranian Plateau in
        the west, to the south-oriented valleys of the Himalayas, the Karakorum, and the
        Pamirs and also those of the high-altitude Hindu Kush (but excluding Afghanistan
        and the Tibetan plateau) in the north, and to the Brahmaputra in the east.
      "Mesoamerica": >-
        The southern boundary is the Panama Canal; the northern boundary is the US/Mexico
        border. Perhaps this boundary should eventually be placed at the northern limit of
        the Mesoamerican cultural area.
      "N Africa": >-
        Northern Africa. North of about 14° N (the latitude of the northern end of
        Lake Chad and north of the Niger, just north of Khartoum, without Eritrea), but
        excluding the Ethiopian Plateau (i.e. no farther east than about 35°).
      "N Coast Asia": >-
        Coastal Northern Asia. Manchuria, Korea, Japan, and Siberia up to about 100 miles
        or 160 km inland from the coast. Also including the Aleutian Islands.
      "Interior New Guinea": >-
        The highlands and most of their north slope.
      "N Coast New Guinea": >-
        Northern coastal New Guinea (up to within about 20 miles of the coast) including
        the Bird’s Head peninsula; small offshore islands (e.g. Karkar) and the Bismarcks
        (New Britain, New Ireland) but not the Solomons.
      "N Australia": >-
        Northern Australia. North of 18° S. (This is an artificial boundary and could
        probably be improved.)
      "Oceania": >-
        Pacific islands, including the Solomons. Western boundary is the Wallace Line
        (about 120° E), so the Philippines, Sulawesi, Flores, Sumba, Timor, etc. are in
        Oceania.
      "S Africa": >-
        Southern Africa. South of about 4.5° N and east of about 10° E. Includes the
        rain forest and everything to the south of it. (The northwest corner is just
        southeast of Cameroon Mountain, or at about Douala, Cameroon. The northeast border
        is from Mogadishu to the Ethiopian border.)
      "S New Guinea": >-
        Southern New Guinea. The southern slope and coast.
      "Southeast Asia": >-
        From the Brahmaputra to near insular Southeast Asia (up to the Wallace Line,
        between Sumbawa and Flores, thus including Sumatra, Java, and Borneo) and most of
        China (but not Qinghai, Tibet, Xinjiang or Inner Mongolia).
      "S Australia": >-
        Southern Australia. South of 18° S. (This is an artificial boundary and could
        probably be improved.)
      "Andean": >-
        Andean South America. The western coast, the Andes, and their eastern slope, south
        of the border of Panama (about 5° N). Southern boundary: about 50° S.
      "African Savannah": >-
        The savannah north of the African rain forest. Between about 15° N and about 5°
        N, and east to about 35° E.
      "Greater Abyssinia": >-
        Between about 5° N and about 17° N, and east of about 35° E (this line slants
        up to about 38° E at 17° N). Includes the Ethiopian plateau and northern Somalia
        (and could possibly be redrawn to include the Yemen tip of the Arabian peninsula).
      "SE South America": >-
        The southeast of South America. From the eastern slopes of the Andes to the
        Atlantic coast, south of 18° S. Includes all of Patagonia and the Gran Chaco, and
        all of Tierra del Fuego.
