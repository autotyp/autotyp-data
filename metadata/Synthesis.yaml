VInflCat:
  Description : >
     Inflectional categories that can be marked separately on a maximally inflected verb form and that
     have at least one overt reflex in the form. When categories are cumulated or semantically conflated
     in a single marker (as is often case with tense, aspect and mood), they are counted as a single
     composite category (e.g. TAM); therefore separate listing of categories entails that they are marked
     separately and are clearly distinguishable. Categories are only coded if they have at least one
     overt morphological reflex in the form (e.g. 'active' is not a category of English synthetic verb
     forms even though such forms are in opposition to a passive construction). Also see Bickel & Nichols'
     chapter on synthesis in the World Atlas of Language Structure (wals.info).
