     The noun plural exemplar is determined as follows: Choose the inflectional plural (or nonsingular)
     marking for nouns. If plural is different from dual, use the true plural. If different nouns have
     different morphological plural formations, use the commonest (or default) one. If animate (or human)
     and inanimate nouns have morphologically different plurals, enter both (creating two records for
     Noun Plural). (If there is yet another morphologically different salient non-default plural, that
     can also be entered in the database as well, but don’t flag it as this plural.) If plural marking
     is described as optional, use it nonetheless (indicate optional nature in the database). Use only
     true plurals; do not use a collective, distributive, etc. if there is no plural.

    'isolating' : >
       The formative is a free phonological word. If it is, it is likely to be written as a separate
       word, though this is not always true: non-isolating formatives like clitics are often written
       as separate words, and isolating formatives are written with hyphens or clitic boundary markers.
       Therefore you will need to look at prosodic factors such as word stress.
    'reduplicative' : >
       A category is marked by some kind of reduplication effect
    'concatenative_and_ablaut' : >
       Concatenative formative plus ablaut (usually stem ablaut).
    'concatenative_and_reduplicative' : >
       Concatenative formative plus reduplication (usually reduplication of stem). If some lexemes take
       just the affix and others take the affix plus the reduplication, choose Concat + redupl and code
       for lexeme-based formative flexivity. (The flexivity lies in whether they do or do not take the
       reduplication part.)
    'concatenative_or_ablaut' : >
       Concatenative formative or ablaut, neither one clearly primary (or both equally primary).
    'ablaut' : >
       Alternation of stem segments in some grammatical context. Distinct from phonologically conditioned
       alternation.

     The noun plural exemplar is determined as follows: Choose the inflectional plural (or nonsingular)
     marking for nouns. If plural is different from dual, use the true plural. If different nouns have
     different morphological plural formations, use the commonest (or default) one. If animate (or human)
     and inanimate nouns have morphologically different plurals, enter both (creating two records for
     Noun Plural). (If there is yet another morphologically different salient non-default plural, that
     can also be entered in the database as well, but don’t flag it as this plural.) If plural marking
     is described as optional, use it nonetheless (indicate optional nature in the database). Use only
     true plurals; do not use a collective, distributive, etc. if there is no plural.

    'concatenative' : >
       The formative is a clitic or segmentable affix. Word-level phonological processes (such as vowel
       harmony), word-internal kinds of sandhi, prosodic phenomena (such as word stress) or general inability
       to stand alone, identify a formative as concatenative (rather than an independent word). Unless
       there is evidence to the contrary, zeroes are coded as concatenative.
    'isolating' : >
       The formative is a free phonological word. If it is, it is likely to be written as a separate
       word, though this is not always true: non-isolating formatives like clitics are often written

       Concatenative formative plus ablaut (usually stem ablaut).

     The noun plural exemplar is determined as follows: Choose the inflectional plural (or nonsingular)
     marking for nouns. If plural is different from dual, use the true plural. If different nouns have
     different morphological plural formations, use the commonest (or default) one. If animate (or human)
     and inanimate nouns have morphologically different plurals, enter both (creating two records for
     Noun Plural). (If there is yet another morphologically different salient non-default plural, that
     can also be entered in the database as well, but don’t flag it as this plural.) If plural marking
     is described as optional, use it nonetheless (indicate optional nature in the database). Use only
     true plurals; do not use a collective, distributive, etc. if there is no plural.

    'semi-restricted' : >
       Can occur with some, but not all host elements (so, NOT a ‘phrasal affix’, but rather simply a
       ‘particle’-like formative that has some degree of selectional restrictions). Allows at least two
       distinct hosts (in terms of their parts of speech categories)

  Notes : >
     The negation exemplar is determined as follows: Choose clausal negation. If there are several negation
     markers, pick the one on conditioned by the leftmost value on the following hierarchies: declarative
     indicative > other illocutionary roles and moods; tense exemplar > other TAM values, i.e. past >
     perfective > realis > others; clausal scope > constituent scope; verbal predicate > other predicate;
     finite > nonfinite

       Allomorphic variation determined by the choice of inflectional category (e.g., a certain stem
       ablaut in certain tense forms, across the regular lexicon)
  Notes : >
     The noun plural exemplar is determined as follows: Choose the inflectional plural (or nonsingular)
     marking for nouns. If plural is different from dual, use the true plural. If different nouns have
     different morphological plural formations, use the commonest (or default) one. If animate (or human)
     and inanimate nouns have morphologically different plurals, enter both (creating two records for
     Noun Plural). (If there is yet another morphologically different salient non-default plural, that
     can also be entered in the database as well, but don’t flag it as this plural.) If plural marking
     is described as optional, use it nonetheless (indicate optional nature in the database). Use only
     true plurals; do not use a collective, distributive, etc. if there is no plural.
