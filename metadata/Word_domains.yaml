  Notes : >
     For the definition of the constituents ('stem', 'affix' etc), see the metadata for 'MorphemeType'
     in morpheme_types. Definition of “±” vs. “+”: 1. Stem + suffix: both stem & suffix must obligatorily,
     simultaneously be present in order for process to apply For example: take hypothetical final devoicing:
     stem alone would be CVb (no final devoicing) stem + suffix would be (CVb)-(CVp)w (final devoicing,
     right edge of stem + suffix) (although I suppose that an alternative domain could simply be right
     edge of suffix only...but I see the stem + suffix as a unit for this process because a suffix occurs
     only in the domain of a (particular) host type) 2. Stem ± suffix: the process may apply ONCE, no
     matter if stem alone or stem + suffix both. For example: final devoicing again: stem alone is CVp
     (yes, final devoicing) stem + suffix (CVb)-(CVp) (final devoicing applies again, but only at right
     most edge, right edge of stem + suffix)”
