  Levels : 
    'CASE' : >
       The inflectional case marker selected for comparison in a user-defined survey. Selection procedure:
       If any of these markers differs from other in their morphological behavior, CASE refers to grammatical
       (core) case; if any core case marker differs from others, CASE refers to accusative, ergative
       or agentive case.
    'NEG' : >
       The form of standard clausal negation selected for comparison in a user-defined survey. Selection
       procedure: If there are several negation markers, pick the one on the left: • declarative indicative
       > other illocutionary roles and moods • TAM exemplar > other TAM values, i.e. past > perfective
       > realis > others • clausal scope > constituent scope • verbal predicate > other predicate • finite
       > nonfinite
    'TAM' : >
       The inflectional tense, aspect, mood, status, etc. marker selected for comparison in a user-defined
       survey. Selection procedure: If any of these markers differ from others in their morphological
       behavior, TAM refers to tense; if any tense marking differs from other tense markers, TAM refers
       to the tense used for basic, aspectually unmarked past time reference, i.e. to the form that serves
       as a simple response to ‘what happened’.
    'Noun Plural' : >
       The inflectional plural (or nonsingular) marking for nouns selected for comparison in a user-defined
       survey. Selection procedure: If plural is different from dual, use the true plural. If different
       nouns have different morphological plural formations, use the commonest (or default) one. If animate
       (or human) and inanimate nouns have morphologically different plurals, enter both (creating two
       records for Noun Plural). (If there is yet another morphologically different salient non-default
       plural, that can also be entered in the database as well, but don’t flag it as this plural.) If
       plural marking is described as optional, use it nonetheless (indicate optional nature in the database).
       Use only true plurals; do not take a collective, distributive, etc. as the exemplar if there is
       no plural.

    'restricted' : >
       Is restricted to a specific type of host. When descriptions are silent about the range of hosts
       that a marker can combine with, but analyze the marker as an “affix”, we assume it is restricted.
    'semi-restricted' : >
       Can occur with some, but not all host elements (so, NOT a ‘phrasal affix’, but rather simply a
       ‘particle’-like formative that has some degree of selectional restrictions). Allows at least two
       distinct hosts (in terms of their parts of speech categories)
    'unrestricted' : >
       occurs with anything (e.g. Turkish mi)

# ------ Slot ------
Slot:

    'agree' : >
       The formative is there because of agreement.
    'assign' : >
       The formative is there because of government, i.e. it is assigned by a head, i.e. it is specified
       by a head’s valence.
    'agr-target' : >
       the formative agrees, but that is not the reason of its presence, i.e. it is present for some
       other reason, e.g. derivation (unlike the type we call “agree”).
    'case assigned, gender agrees' : >
    'free' : >
       In most contexts, use of the formative is the speaker’s choice. But to the degree that the formative
       is inflectional, there are some grammatical environments where the use is compulsory (e.g. sequence
       of tenses.)
